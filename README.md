**Project Structure:**

The project follows a standard React structure. Key components and functionalities are organized within the `src` directory. This includes components for:

*   Dashboard
*   Charts
*   Report generation

- **api/** holds your single `callApi` helper plus all CRUD modules.  
- **components/** contains both layout elements (Sidebar, Topbar) and generic widgets.  
- **contexts/** centralizes auth & theme state.  
- **hooks/** is where you keep reusable logic (login flow, storage sync).  
- **pages/** matches your route hierarchyâ€”each feature gets its own folder.  
- **styles/** keeps CSS scoped via modules.  
- **utils/** houses pure functions (validation, date formatting, etc.). 

This structure ensures clear separation of concerns and easy navigation as your SIMS dashboard grows.
